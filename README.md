yea this is a little sorting script for a array that is getting sorted via bubble sort, i got bored and sice i neber touched any form of sorting data i thought it would be a nice challange, turns out, even if it's just bubble sort it was really interesting, it took me a bit to figure out how to propperly use it and impliment it correctly, i mainly had issues with scoping outside the array and figuring out how to actually stop the sorting once it's sorted haha!
